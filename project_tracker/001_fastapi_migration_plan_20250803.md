# FastAPI Migration Plan for Tokimeki
# Created: 2025-08-03
# Last Updated: 2025-08-03
# Status: Planning Phase

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Migrate Flask application to FastAPI for improved async performance and better scalability.

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
- Flask application with 8+ route modules
- Blocking I/O operations in chat API and stock data provider
- Synchronous ML model inference
- Rate limiting with Flask-Limiter
- Redis caching system
- Usage tracking and monitoring

## MIGRATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup
**Objectives:**
- Set up FastAPI framework and dependencies
- Create new project structure
- Configure async middleware and CORS
- Set up rate limiting with slowapi

**Key Deliverables:**
- New requirements.txt with FastAPI dependencies
- Core app structure with main.py
- Configuration management system
- Middleware setup (CORS, rate limiting, logging)

**Dependencies:**
- fastapi==0.104.1
- uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
- httpx==0.25.2
- slowapi==0.1.9

### Phase 2: Core Services Migration
**Objectives:**
- Convert cache manager to async Redis operations
- Migrate usage tracker to async operations
- Set up dependency injection system
- Create async service layer

**Key Deliverables:**
- AsyncCacheService with Redis.asyncio
- AsyncUsageService with concurrent tracking
- Dependency injection container
- Service layer architecture

**Performance Targets:**
- 50% reduction in cache operation latency
- Concurrent request handling capability

### Phase 3: Priority API Endpoints
**Objectives:**
- Migrate chat endpoint (DeepSeek) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
- Convert stock data provider to async
- Implement concurrent API calls
- Add connection pooling

**Key Deliverables:**
- Async chat endpoint with httpx
- Async stock data fetching with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Concurrent model comparison functionality
- HTTP client connection pooling

**Performance Targets:**
- Chat API: 3-5x faster response times (2-10s → 0.5-2s)
- Stock data: 2-3x faster concurrent requests
- 70% reduction in blocking operations

### Phase 4: Remaining Endpoints
**Objectives:**
- Migrate sentiment analysis endpoints
- Convert speech analysis to async
- Update monitoring and management APIs
- Implement background tasks

**Key Deliverables:**
- Async ML model inference
- Background task processing
- Async monitoring endpoints
- Error handling improvements

### Phase 5: Advanced Async Features
**Objectives:**
- Implement concurrent API calls
- Add async model inference
- Optimize connection pooling
- Add streaming responses

**Key Deliverables:**
- Concurrent model comparison
- Async ML service with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Optimized HTTP client configuration
- Streaming chat responses

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization
**Objectives:**
- Fine-tune async performance
- Implement caching strategies
- Add monitoring and metrics
- Load testing and optimization

**Key Deliverables:**
- Performance benchmarks
- Caching optimization
- Monitoring dashboard
- Load test results
