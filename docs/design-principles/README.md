## The 5-Step Algorithm

1. **Make Requirements Less Dumb** - Question every requirement, even if it comes from a smart person
2. **Delete Parts/Processes** - If you aren't adding things back in 10% of the time, you aren't deleting enough
3. **Simplify/Optimize** - Only after steps 1 and 2 are done
4. **Accelerate Cycle Time** - Speed up production
5. **Automate** - Last step, for proven stable processes

## Application

See [Market Pulse v3](../features/marketpulse/architecture-layered-v3.md) for implementation example.
